# upstream server. This is useful for GeoDNS and CDNs to work, and is exactly
# the same configuration as most public DNS servers.

# is still possible to probe client version according to behavior differences,
# such as TLS handshaking, handling of malformed packets, and specific bugs.

# buggy, old, or insecure clients, and to workaround specific bugs.

# and older Firefox.)
